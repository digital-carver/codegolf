% Finding determinant
th    % concatenate the matrix to itself sideways
3LZ)  % chop off the last column (since the Rule of Sarrus doesn't need it)
t     % duplicate this matrix (say S)
,     % do this twice:
  3:q&Xd  % get the first three diagonals of S
  ps      % multiply each diagonal's values and add the results
  wP      % switch and flip the matrix (to get the popposing diagonals next time)
]w    % close loop, switch to have correct order of sums
-     % subtract - we now have the determinant
lw/   % invert that

% Finding adjugate using Cayleyâ€“Hamilton formula
GtY*  % A^2 term
tXds  % trace(A^2) for term 1 of formula
GXdsU % (trace(A))^2 for term1 of formula
w-    % (trace(A))^2 - trace(A^2)
IXy*  % multiply that by the identity matrix
2/    % divide that by 2 - term 1 complete
+
GtXds* % A*trA for term 2 of formula
-      % subtract to get adj(A)

*      % multiply by the inverse of determinant we found earlier
       % implicit output
