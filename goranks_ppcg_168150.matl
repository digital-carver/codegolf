% ### Explanation:
% 
% * Subtract 'k' from the last character (gives n = -7, 0, 5 for 'd', 'k', 'p' respectively). 
% 
% * Compute v = n^2+6n-1 (gives 7, -1, 54 respectively). 
% 
% * Multiply that value v by the actual rank number (so k levels get negative products, d levels go from 7 to 49, p levels from 54 and above). 
% 
% * Do that for both input strings, compare the products
% 
% * Get the input string corresponding to the greater product
