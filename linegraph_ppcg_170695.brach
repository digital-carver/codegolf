    {        }ᶠ      Find all outputs of this predicate:
     ⊇l₂.             A two-element subset of the input
         c            which when its subarrays are concatenated
          ¬≠          does not have all different elements
                      (i.e. some element is repeated)
            ∧         (no further constraint on output)
               cᵐ²   Join vertex names in each subsubarray in that result
