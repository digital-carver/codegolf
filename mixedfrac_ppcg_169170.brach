ḍ                   % split the input in half
 {            }     % and verify that
  lᵛ                % each half has the same length (i.e. the string had even length)
    &ht¬ị           % and the last character of the first half is 
                    %  not a number (it should be "/")
         &t↔ị1      % and the second half when reversed is the number 1
                    %  i.e. the denominator should be a power of 10
