,1{hH&t<NḋlH;N}ⁱ⁽t


                      Implicit input, say [5, 3]
,1                    Append 1 to the input list. [5, 3, 1]
  {           }ⁱ⁽     Repeat this predicate the number of times given by
                        the first element of the list (5),
                        on the rest of the list [3, 1]
   hH&                Let's call the first element H
      t<N             There is a number N greater than the second element
         ḋ            Whose prime factorization's
          l           length
           H          is equal to H
            ;N        Then, pair that N with H and let that be input for
                      the next iteration
                 t    At the end of iterations, take the last N
                      This is implicitly the output
